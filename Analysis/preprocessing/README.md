Vignettes on the *data-processing* steps of the analysis.
---------------------------------------------------------

The code here must be worked through in the following order for dependencies to
be correctly constructed:

1. [preprocess_data.md](preprocess_data.md) - This includes the initial data processing

2. [extract_storm_events.md](extract_storm_events.md) - This includes the storm event extraction, and various bias-corrections and exploratory data analyses.

Following these steps, the vignette continues in [../statistical_model_fit](../statistical_model_fit).
