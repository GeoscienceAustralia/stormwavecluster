This folder contains markdown tutorials on the *data-processing* steps of the analysis.

They must be worked through in the following order for dependencies to be correctly constructed:

1. [preprocess_data.md](preprocess_data.md) - This includes the initial data processing

2. [extract_storm_events.md](extract_storm_events.md) - This includes the storm event extraction, and various bias-corrections and exploratory data analyses.
