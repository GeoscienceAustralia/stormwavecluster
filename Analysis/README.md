Storm wave clustering analysis for Old Bar
------------------------------------------

These folders contain code implementing the storm clustering model at Old Bar.

If you have not used them before, then note they should be worked through in order:

1. [preprocessing](preprocessing) contains initial data processing and
exploratory analyses. It must be run first
2. [statistical_model_fit](statistical_model_fit) contains the fit of the
statistical model

Folders with names similar to the above having **_perturbed_data** appended
contain code to facilitate running the above analyses many times, with slightly
perturbed data. See the README's and code therein for information.
