# Introduction
------------------

This document follows on from
[statistical_model_univariate_distributions.md](statistical_model_univariate_distributions.md)
in describing our statistical analysis of storm waves at Old Bar. 

It illustrates the process of modelling the joint distribution of all storm
variables, after their univariate distributions have already been fit. Recall
from the previous section that the univariate distributions are themselves
conditional on the event time of year, and mean annual SOI value. 

It is essential that the code in
[statistical_model_univariate_distributions.md](statistical_model_univariate_distributions.md)
has alread been run, and produced an Rdata file
*'Rimages/session_univariate_distributions_FALSE_0.Rdata'*. **To make sure, the
code below throws an error if the latter file does not exist.**

```r
# Check that the pre-requisites exist
if(!file.exists('Rimages/session_univariate_distributions_FALSE_0.Rdata')){
    stop('It appears you have not yet run the code in statistical_model_univariate_distributions.Rmd. That must be run before continuing')
}
```

Supposing the above did not generate any errors, and you have R installed,
along with all the packages required to run this code, and a copy of the
*stormwavecluster* git repository, then you should be able to re-run the
analysis here by simply copy-pasting the code. Alternatively, it can be run
with the `knit` command in the *knitr* package: 

```r
library(knitr)
knit('statistical_model_vine_copula.Rmd')
```

The basic approach followed here is to:
* **Step 1: FIXME**

Later we will use the statistical model to simulate synthetic storm event
time-series.
