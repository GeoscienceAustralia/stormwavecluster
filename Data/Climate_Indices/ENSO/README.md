SOI is a normalised pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin, and is a
well known index of ENSO.

The data here were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology here:
    http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/glossary/soi.shtml

The data was downloaded in mid 2016, and truncated to end in 2015, since our
code requires complete years of data.
